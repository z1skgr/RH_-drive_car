## General Information

the ability of an innovative algorithm to
offer personalized experiences online in a simple racing video game. We use a recent stochastic
planning algorithm named Rolling Horizon Evolution Algorithm (RHEA), which generates
content (parts of a race track) based on the difficulty of the level and the playerâ€™s in-game
performance. The algorithm is tested against Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents; AI racing agents
define the bounds of the flow channel within which the players are assessed. The algorithm then
attempts to bring the level of difficulty to match player performance through its fitness function


## Features
## Technologies

## Prerequisites 
This project needs the ML-Agents environment version 0.15.0 to be set up. At best I'd suggest to follow the [official installation guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md). However the following steps should suffice:

1. Get Python 3.6 64-bit (the 64 bit seems necessary, at least on Windows)
2. Get Unity 2020.1+
3. Download the ML-Agents 1.0.0+ package (see https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_12_docs/docs/Installation.md)
4. Install dependencies: `pip3 install "mlagents"`
5. Clone this repository
6. Open project in Unity
