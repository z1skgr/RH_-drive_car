## General Information
## Features

## Prerequisites 
This project needs the ML-Agents environment version 0.15.0 to be set up. At best I'd suggest to follow the [official installation guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md). However the following steps should suffice:

1. Get Python 3.6 64-bit (the 64 bit seems necessary, at least on Windows)
2. Get Unity 2020.1+
3. Download the ML-Agents 1.0.0+ package (see https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_12_docs/docs/Installation.md)
4. Install dependencies: `pip3 install "mlagents"`
5. Clone this repository
6. Open project in Unity
